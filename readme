# IBM FinishLine Challange Toronto 2018 Winning Hackathron App - TravelBot
# This bot app was built by a team of 5 people, with each individual doing different things
# I was tasked with doing the API research and implementation for the bot.
# Using the WAS service we are able to create a Slack bot which is able to converse with users,
# in order to plan their travel. Includes travel, accommodation, 
# and activities for your trip based on information given by the user during the conversation.
# After the conversation is completed an itinerary is auto generated wit h all of the relevant information to 
# the users travel plans. The application is very accessible and easy to use due to the integration of 
# the solution into the Slack application. IBM Watson is able to grab all of the trip details for the user 
# so he/she  doesnâ€™t have to search around every website for different parts of his trip
# The use of the WAS service allows us to create a human like interface for seamless travel 
# itinerary creation through a simple conversation.
# Using the TripAdvisor API and the Amadeus API, we were able to implement this successfully 
# And make a presentation to the IBM judges and Won the Hackathron Challenge at the IBMFinishLine Toronto 2018
